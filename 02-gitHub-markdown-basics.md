## Basic writing

### Paragraphs

On July 2, an alien mothership entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen saucer-shaped "destroyer" spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide.

On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, participated in an assault on a destroyer near the city of Los Angeles.

### Blockquotes

In the words of Abraham Lincoln:

> Pardon my french

### Styling text

*This text will be italic*
**This text will be bold**

**Everyone _must_ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.**

## Lists

### Unordered lists

* Item
* Item
* Item

This is a paragraph used as separator between 2 lists

- Item
- Item
- Item

### Ordered lists

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Nested lists

1. Item 1
  1. A corollary to the above item.
  2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
  * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
    * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3

## Code formatting

### Inline formats

Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject` and turn it into `**Reasonable**Project`.

### Multiple lines

Check out this neat program I wrote:

```
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
what is x
```
